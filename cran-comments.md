* This is a new release.
* The package uses a mapping table which is ~3MB to map beteewn differnt disease coding systems. We decided it is too complicated to ask the users to 
download this table from the NHS website, which require them to register a new account. We decided it is much more
user friendly to include the table as an internal data object.
