Description: We propose an age-dependent topic modelling (ATM) model,
    providing a low-rank representation of longitudinal records of
    hundreds of distinct diseases in large EHR data sets. The model
    assigns to each individual topic weights for several disease topics;
    each disease topic reflects a set of diseases that tend to co-occur as
    a function of age, quantified by age-dependent topic loadings for each
    disease. The model assumes that for each disease diagnosis, a topic is
    sampled based on the individual’s topic weights (which sum to 1 across
    topics, for a given individual), and a disease is sampled based on the
    individual’s age and the age-dependent topic loadings (which sum to 1
    across diseases, for a given topic at a given age). The model
    generalises the latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) model by allowing
    topic loadings for each topic to vary with age.
