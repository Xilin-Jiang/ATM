## ATM
Age-dependent topic modelling (in progress)

The Goal of ATM is inferring comorbidity profiles for individuals at Biobank Scale. Details of the Method is available at https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.23.22281420v2 

## Illustration of the algorithm

## Estimate individual comorbidity weight using the comorbidity profiles inferred from UK Biobank.(XXXinsert code example here; use simulated data to show)

## Inferring comorbidity profiles from individual diagnostic data set. 
(XXX this is computational expensive, therefore not only provide R package, also complie an executable)
